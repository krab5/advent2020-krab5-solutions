These are my solutions to the programming challenges of the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/)

This repo contains one directory for each day, and each directory is basically a Haskell program, with a `Main.hs` module as its entry point.

Each directory also contain a Makefile to ease building (so just do a `make` to build the program).

Please note that these are _my_ solutions; they're far from perfect but I find some of them interesting.
